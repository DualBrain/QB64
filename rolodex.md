Patreon and other donations are currently paused until further notice.  Until such time that a dedicated "treasurer" is determined and, more importantly, specific uses for such funds are determined - no money is being asked for. If and when the opportunity for sponsorship is reinstated, it will be the responsibility of the "treasurer" to distribute funds and publish these distributions for the general public to see (complete transparency).

In other words, if you are being asked to pay for anything related to the development of QB64 you are being ripped off.
