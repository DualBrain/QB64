## Wiki

Although you can find several copies of the QB64 wiki on the internet, many of these exist as *backup copies* due to the past instability issues around QB64 .org and .net websites and (most likely) aren't currently maintained.

To remedy this, a recent project was begun to transition the wiki so that it is managed in the same way as the source code; meaning it is now directly managed and hosted within the [github repo](https://github.com/QB64Official/qb64). You can find this official wiki at:
