P.S. I had finished this demo for the competition in a hurry, cause I am busy
with other lame things after that (Exams, e.t.c..) Hopefully, I may fix
possible bad things in this demo in a final version found somewhere around my
site (http://users.auth.gr/mkargas)

Time to rest... cu later!

### QBjs

> Please note that QBjs is still in early development and support for these examples is extremely experimental (meaning will most likely not work). With that out of the way, give it a try!
