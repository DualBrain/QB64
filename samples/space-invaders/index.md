Taito's Space Invaders


    ##     The Invaders march ...
   ####      Bom bom bom bom ...
  ######       Left, right, fire!
 ## ## ##        Faster, faster they march ...
 ########          Suddenly you're 11 again!
   #  #              Dodge the bombs ...
  # ## #               They're turning green ...
 # #  # #                Get them before they land!

This game is mailware. That is, it's free to use and distribute anywhere you
like, but only on condition that you keep the two files together and that you
don't charge any payment for it. Also, when you download it, email me on the

Also, I cannot be held responsible if this program does anything nasty to your
machine. It hasn't damaged anyone's PC that I'm aware of and there's no reason
why it should, really.
