## GitHub

Unfortunately **there is currently no official location** for where to get QB64 (due to the events of early 2022). Currently you can find the latest "official" versions at:

- [QB64 v2.0.2 (GitHub)](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64): Abandoned GitHub repo of the now disbanded "QB64 Team". (NOTE: The "QB64 Team" shouldn't be confused with *QB64 Official*.)

With that said, a combination of old and new community members are in the process of "rebooting" the team with new focus on more foundational items and this effort can be found at:

- [QB64 Official](https://github.com/QB64Official/qb64)

To be clear, the *QB64 Official* organization is currently at ground zero in the process of rebooting.  A lot of work needs to be done to get a new team formed and work progressing forward. If this is something you might be interested in participating in, please connect with the organization through the repo or via [discord](community.md).

First and foremost...

> In open source the principle should be that you have... a social contract. Not a legal contract, but a social contract: if you use this software and it's valuable to you, instead of sending someone money, which is what you would've done in the early '90s with shareware. Instead of doing that, if you find a bug, contribute that bug back. That is the principle. The principle is that you have a social contract and a moral obligation to assist the thing that assisted you.

In order to prevent (or a the very least minimize) past circumstances from being able to repeat, several suggestions are being put forth:

- It must be made very clear that the "ownership" of QB64 is by the QB64 Community.
- Project is and will remain MIT licensed.
- The initial plan should be about stability, bug-fixes, documentation, samples, etc. with a focus on growing community; an effort should be made to highlight the work of those using QB64.  Adding more to an arguably shaky foundation doesn't seem to make sense; focus on fixing what is already there with a primary (never to be lost) attention toward compatibility with QBasic/QB4.5.
- Should have clear structure in place especially when a project moves from a single developer to many; so with that suggesting [Minimum Viable Governance: lightweight community structure to grow your FOSS projects](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/).
- Have a clearly defined Code of Conduct that will be followed by all involved; so suggesting adopting the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct used by the .NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct#:~:text=Contributor%20Covenant%20Code%20of%20Conduct%201%20Preamble.%20The,...%207%20Enforcement%20Guidelines.%20...%208%20Attribution.%20).  This Code of Conduct is in effect for QB64.com and any official related repo(s), Discord, Forum(s), etc.
- Will review Rob Galleons philosophy for contributions as part of defining the MVG.
- There will be no [Benevolent Dictator for Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) role; the only person that could claim that role has seperated himself from the project... as such, the need for a MVG structure is needed for QB64.
- Any donations, fundraisers, financial contributions, etc. will not be considered in any manner unless/until a solid foundation exists and a real treasurer is in place.  This may never actually happen, but until it does... no one, period, should be asking for any money in any way as related to QB64.
- Once the dust completely settles and we can truly look to the future.
