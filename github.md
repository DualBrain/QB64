Unfortunately **there is currently no official location** for where to get QB64 (due to the events of early 2022). Currently you can find the latest "official" versions at:

- [QB64 v1.3 (GitHub)](https://github.com/Galleondragon/qb64): GitHub clone of GalleonDragon's Google Code repo (automatically generated via Google Code).  This is the SDL version.
- [QB64 v2.0.2 (GitHub)](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64): GitHub repo of the QB64 Team.

With that said, there is an attempt to "reboot" the team with new blood and this effort can be found at:

- [QB64 Official](https://github.com/QB64Official)

To be clear, the *QB64 Official* organization is currently at ground zero.  A lot of work needs to be done to get a new team formed and work progressing forward - this, of course, is assuming this is will even be possible.  So, for now, consider it a placeholder and let's all collectively hope that something will progress forward.  If this is something you might be interested in participating in, please connect with the organization through the repo or via [discord](community.md).

Although not official, it might be of interest to take a look at a QB64 fork that is by a guy that "wants to do his own thing, on his own time, in his own way, for himself".  This fork might just be exactly what you are looking for - but, then again, it might not be... and the developer behind it is perfectly OK with that.
