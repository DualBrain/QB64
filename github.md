Unfortunately there is currently no official source for where to get QB64 (due to the events of early 2022). With that said, you can find the latest "official" versions at:

- [QB64 v1.3 (GitHub)](https://github.com/Galleondragon/qb64): GitHub clone of GalleonDragon's Google Code repo (automatically generated via Google Code).  This is the SDL version.
- [QB64 v2.0.2 (GitHub)](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64): GitHub repo of the QB64 Team.

Additionally, there are several "unofficial" forks:

- ["Phoenix Edition"](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe/)
- [SpriggsySpriggs](https://github.com/SpriggsySpriggs/qb64)
- [TheJoyfulProgrammer "QB64-X"](https://github.com/TheJoyfulProgrammer/QB64-X)
- [SMcNeill (SDL)](https://github.com/SteveMcNeill/QB64-SDL)
