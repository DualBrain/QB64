> A brief note regarding the current released version (v2.0.2, November 2021); it is still available via the now "disbanded" QB64Team repo; a new release is still the in the process awaiting for the dust to settle after the April 2022 "incident".  The 2.0.2 version is currently working except for the built in help system as that was being pulled from the now MIA qb64.org. Discussions as to how future releases will be handled is still taking place and more details will follow. The QB64Official repo is picking up where QB64Team left off. Additionally, other individuals are working on new versions; so please be sure to take a moment to take a look at the [Development build(s)](dev.md) page for links to these forks.

**How BASIC made its way into the 21st century**

The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.

Notice the DECLARE LIBRARY block used to access Windows' API." style="float:left;width:214px;height:144px;padding:6px">

The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.

Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.

QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.
