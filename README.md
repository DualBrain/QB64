## Get QB64

- [Download QB64](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64/releases/tag/v2.0.2)
- [Development build(s)](dev.md) 
- [Source Code](github.md)

> A brief note regarding the current released version (v2.0.2, November 2021); it is still available via the now "disbanded" QB64Team repo; a new release is still the in the process awaiting for the dust to settle after the April 2022 "incident".  The 2.0.2 version is currently working except for the built in help system as that was being pulled from the now MIA qb64.org. 

> One can only hope that the QB64 project will resume after the disbandment of the "QB64 Team" and the negative actions of "RCCola"; but until then the last version of QB64 (specifically, the OpenGL branch) is v2.0.2.  The last version of the SDL branch is (apparently) v1.3.

**How BASIC made its way into the 21st century**

The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.

Notice the DECLARE LIBRARY block used to access Windows' API." style="float:left;width:214px;height:144px;padding:6px">

The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.

Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.

QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.

## Who created QB64?

## What is QBjs?

[QBJS](qbjs.md) can be considered a sort of *sister* project of QB64. It is heavily inspired by folks that have a huge appreciation for QB64 and the main developer that is working on this is "simply" continuing forward on a project that originally grew out of a pet project of his for QB64. This (previous) project, written in QB64, allows you to write your code in QB64 and then "convert" it to Javascript. The [QBJS](qbjs.md) project is taking this further by providing the necessary tools to write your code in the browser directly.

## What about the qb64.net website/domain?

Please make note that the .net domain for QB64 is highly suspect. Apparently the story goes that someone forgot to renew the domain name and it was snipped by a questionable party that subsequently mirrored the previous websites information and spammed it with dubious advertising. At this point it has nothing to do with QB64 and, ultimately, should be completely avoided given that the content could contain suspect binaries potentially containing malware. Additionally, it's been stated in the community has potentially having malware as part of the site - potentially infecting your machine by simply browsing to it. So, in the end, if you do venture there be sure to excercise caution.
