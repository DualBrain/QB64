## QBJS

The QBasic you love, now on the web.

[![QBJS](images/qbjs.png)](https://qbjs.org)

[QBJS](http://qbjs.org) is an implementation of the Basic programming language for the web, with multimedia support and easy sharing of programs. It aims to be compatible with [QB64](htts://qb64.com), which in turn implements the same dialect as the classic QBasic.

The project is in active development as of 30 March 2022. It can be tried [online](https://qbjs.org); documentation and releases are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/boxgaming/qbjs).

Support for browser APIs is built-in as of version 0.4.0-beta; a game engine is included separately.
