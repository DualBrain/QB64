[Robert Ryan Carter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertrcarter/) **NUKES** all content related to QB64.org across website, wiki, forum, twitter, youtube, podcasts (except his own), etc.  However, continues to accept Patreon donations...

This "action" appears to be in response to the community vocal backlash to the official stance (put in place, from what I understand, by [Robert Ryan Carter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertrcarter/)) **"Any media uploaded to QB64 sites, are the property of the QB64 Project."**

This statement brought into question of who owns (or rather the immediate loss of ownership of) the content already shared across QB64.org properties (even before they became part of QB64.org).

I can share that I had the same concerns but understood the underlying *reason(s)* behind the statement.  I shared with the *team* what Microsoft has on their forums and they did indeed update the terms to be a lot more clear.  However, due to banning in Discord and level of anger built up over time - it appears that this new terms of service, which was clearly defining that people owned their content and that permission was being shared with QB64 for a specific set of usages. A circumstance of too little too late apparently.

I personally think that Robert has a lot of explaining to do and question whether or not he has broken a host of laws in his actions.  In the very least, his actions are not excusable.

Hopefully the community can regroup and recover over time.
