The [Jam For All Basic Dialects #3](https://itch.io/jam/jam-for-all-basic-dialects-3) contest has been announced!

> It is easier to learn than many other programming languages as BASIC's commands are similar to English and it has a simple set of rules. Nowadays there are many BASIC dialects which are suitable for game development. Many of them are free of charge. I list some BASIC dialects which are suitable for game development here: (But you can use any other BASIC dialects which are not on the following list for this game jam.)

> The jam will be suitable for any kind of game developer and you will have so much fun in this jam.  Furthermore,  all entrants can share their experiences of using BASIC dialects in the jam. Before the jam starts, three themes will be selected from the following six themes by me.(1. War  2. Random  3. Escape  4. Powerful  5. One Way Trip  6. Circles, Squares & Triangles)

The contest will take during the month of August, so be sure to check it out!

Some planning has taken place and we can announce that work has begun on first fixing the issues surrounding the content behind the wiki and how this will be made available, maintained and ensure stability. Work has begun but it will take some time complete the full transition; with that said, the effort should worth it in the end as it helps to better future proof the content.

[Robert Ryan Carter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertrcarter/) **NUKES** all content related to QB64.org across website, wiki, forum, twitter, youtube, podcasts (except his own), etc.  However, continues to accept Patreon donations...

This "action" appears to be in response to the community vocal backlash to the official stance (put in place, from what I understand, by [Robert Ryan Carter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertrcarter/)) **"Any media uploaded to QB64 sites, are the property of the QB64 Project."**

This statement brought into question of who owns (or rather the immediate loss of ownership of) the content already shared across QB64.org properties (even before they became part of QB64.org).

I can share that I had the same concerns but understood the underlying *reason(s)* behind the statement.  I shared with the *team* what Microsoft has on their forums and they did indeed update the terms to be a lot more clear.  However, due to banning in Discord and level of anger built up over time - it appears that this new terms of service, which was clearly defining that people owned their content and that permission was being shared with QB64 for a specific set of usages. A circumstance of too little too late apparently.

I personally think that Robert has a lot of explaining to do and question whether or not he has broken a host of laws in his actions.  In the very least, his actions are not excusable.

Hopefully the community can regroup and recover over time.
