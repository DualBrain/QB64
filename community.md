## Community

There are many ways to connect and interact with other QB64 community members.

### Forum

> Going with a more "traditional" approach to on-line communities, forums provide a great way to get to know people, share knowledge and find help.

- [QB64 Official](https://qb64.boards.net/)

Although the following forums aren't specific to QB64, they may be of interest...

- [SyntaxBomb](https://www.syntaxbomb.com/)
- [Friends of Basic](https://friends-of-basic.freeforums.net/board/6/qb64)
- [The Retro Dev](https://www.theretrodev.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=48)
- [Basic 4 All](http://basic4all.epizy.com/)

There was a previous forum (during the QB64.org era), but it was shutdown by it's owner (re: "events of early 2022"); thankfully a community member has managed to restore an backup copy and made it available in read-only/archival format.

### Discord

> Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging platform.  Users have the ability to communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers".  A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice chat channels which can be accessed via invite links.  

The official Discord server follows the published [Code of Conduct](conduct.md).

The following Discord servers are spun up without thought to how the community (which is mostly anonymous) will be managed; meaning no defined *Code of Conduct* or, if some rules do exist, they are very relaxed in being enforced.  Due to this, if you don't "fit in" (*click*) with the existing manager(s) of the server; you could easily be *mistreated* and/or *banned*.  To say this another way, the following have **NO** clearly defined *Code of Conduct* - so experience varies widely and subject to individual tastes.

### Facebook

> If you are on Facebook, you can connect with people who share your interests. Meet new people, share knowledge or get support.

Regarding *Code of Conduct* on Facebook groups, there are fundamental / basic enforceable guidelines in place for all of Facebook that will carry through to Facebook groups - above and beyond these fundamental guidelines, the rest is up to each individual group. When participating in these groups be sure to review any pinned messages and/or description for specifics.
