## Community

A note regarding the below entries labeled as "QB64 Team"; the events of early 2022 resulted in the total disbandment of what was referred to as the "QB64 Team" and are included primarily for historical purposes.

### Discord

> Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging platform.  Users have the ability to commuicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers".  A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice chat channels which can be accessed via invite links.  

At this point, none of these Discord servers are to be considered *official*. Additionally, many Discord servers are spun up without thought to how the community (which is mostly anonymous) will be managed; meaning no defined *Code of Conduct*.  Due to this, if you don't "fit in" (*click*) with the existing manager(s) of the server; you could easily be *mistreated* and/or *banned*.

- [QB64 (GotBASIC.com)](https://discord.gg/DQSt8QAM): Official Discord for [GotBASIC.com](https://gotbasic.com) which follows the same *Code of Coduct* as the [.NET Foundation Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct).

Please be aware that the following Discord servers don't appear to have any sort of specific *Code of Conduct* defined...

### Facebook

> If you are on Facebook, you can connect with people who share your interests. Meet new poeple, share knowledge or get support.

Regarding *Code of Conduct* on Facebook groups, there are fundamental / basic enforcable guidelines in place for all of Facebook that will carry through to Facebook groups - above and beyone these fundamental guidelines, the rest is up to each individual group. When participating in these groups be sure to review any pinned messages and/or description for specifics.

### Forum

### Reddit

- [QB64 Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/qb64): A subreddit to discuss all things QB64. QB64 uses the simplicity of QBasic, but with a slew of newer commands, not to mention massively expanded capabilities. It's designed to be 100% backwards compatible with your old QBasic programs Too!
