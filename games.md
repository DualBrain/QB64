### Proof-of-Concepts

The following games are designed as visible examples demonstrating techniques, ideas and/or engines/frameworks.

**Sleighless**

Oh no! Santa has fallen out of the sleigh!  Rudolph is gone and now Santa must save Christmas alone and... Sleighless!  This is a [demonstration](https://boxgm.itch.io/sleighless) of the GX game engine's ability to export games built in QB64 to the web.

Zelda - The Legend of GX
![ZeldaGX](https://qb64forum.alephc.xyz/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4528.0;attach=18051;image)

Since there are a number of zelda projects currently in-progress, I thought I'd put together a little version as a shameless plug for GX.  One of my current game projects is actually a NES mashup that will have crossover from a number of titles.  So I already had the map built using the GX map editor.  This version will let you walk the entire overworld map.  As an example I've also implemented the lost woods maze.  There are triggers on the map for all of the cave and dungeon entrances.  At the moment this will take you to an empty cave map.  (I haven't built any dungeon maps.)  If you exit the cave it reloads the overworld map and puts you back in the right spot.

### Game Engine

The following entries are designed (hopefully) to make it easier for a QB64 game developer to get started actually building what they imagine without having to start at completely ground zero.

**GX Game Engine**

[GX](https://github.com/boxgaming/gx) is a basic game engine... literally. This is a Game(G) Engine(X) built with and for QB64. GX supports basic 2D gaming: platformer, top-down, etc.... you know, classic NES/SNES type games.

### Incomplete/Abandoned?

*coming soon*
