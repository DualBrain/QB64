`KEYWORDS`

Items in capital letters are BASIC keywords. Keywords are a required part of the statement syntax, unless they are enclosed in brackets.

`placeholders`

Items in lowercase are placeholders for information you must supply in the statement (such as a filename$). The QB64 syntax uses data-type suffixes for placeholders that must be a specific data type. Placeholders that can be more than one data type do not have data-type suffixes.

`[optional item]`

Items inside square brackets are optional.

`{choice1 | choice2}`

Braces and a vertical bar indicate a choice between two or more items. You must use one of the items in the statement unless the braces are enclosed in square brackets.
