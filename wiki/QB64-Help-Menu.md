This is QB64's built-in help system. It's data is based on the QB64 Wiki. In fact, the pages in this built-in help are duplicated copies of the online Wiki and are displayed here in a **modified** form. It should be obvious, that we can't reproduce the detailed output of a full fledged web browser here, especially tables are a bit too complex to handle it here.
