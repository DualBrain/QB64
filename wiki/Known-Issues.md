The first rule regarding whether or not something should be on this list is the question of whether or not there is a difference of behavior between QB64 and QBasic 1.1 and/or QB4.5 (for core commands).  As for additional keywords (underscore commands), there may be some gray area regarding what it should / shouldn't do and will need to be discussed further before including on this list.

As a general reference, please see [Keywords currently not supported by QB64](Keywords-currently-not-supported-by-QB64).

## PAINT (Pattern)

The [Tile Demo Sample](https://qb64.com/samples/tile-demo/) is very different in QBasic versus QB64; specifically, the pattern simply isn't painted. See [#2](../issues/2).
