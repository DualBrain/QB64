*Example usage:* IF x [Not_Equal](Not-Equal) 320 THEN PRINT "Not in center of screen"

* Statements will evaluate as True or -1 when two values are not equal or False or 0 when equal. 
* More than one <> symbol in a numerical statement will create a [Boolean](Boolean) evaluation of the ensuing numerical pairs.
